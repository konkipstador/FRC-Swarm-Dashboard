<!--
    This is the SWARM Dashboard example configuration file.
    Keys are points that data is anchored to. This is made
    so that both sides of the transfer process can identify
    where data should go, and makes requesting data much
    easier. Also included in the configuration files are the
    X and Y coordinates of the label where the data should be
    placed on the GUI. Altogether, the config file is to guide
    the data from the RoboRio to the GUI and to provide an easy
    way to store GUI layouts.
